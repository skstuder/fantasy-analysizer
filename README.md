Deployed with netlify: https://pulpfantasypointpotiental.netlify.app/

Pulpmx fantasy motocross utilizes a handicap scoring system that can be intimidating for beginners. This project shows the point potential for each handicap and allstar status possibility. This site has gotten used quite a bit by pulpmx fantasy players and has been used and posted on the official fantasy instagram story which was a cool accomplishment, one of the first fun projects i've made that has been a useful tool.

## Build Setup

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

## Tools used

Nuxt, Tailwind, Netlify. Learned a lot about Nuxt with this project, even though it behaves like a SPA.

## Todo

Considering adding a rider analysis page that shows previous results of each rider in a dashboard.
